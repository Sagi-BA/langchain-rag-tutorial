# ðŸ‘€ Langchain RAG Tutorial

> You can find video tutorial to build this application [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/nn25oTz8zxE).

This is a Python application that enables you to load a PDF file and ask questions about its contents using natural language. The application leverages Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses based on the PDF data. The LLM will only provide answers related to the information present in the PDF.

## How it works

The application reads the PDF file and processes the data. It utilizes OpenAI LLMs alongside Langchain to answer your questions. From the results, I used an appropriate response with the help of a LLM.

The application Streamlit creates the graphical user interface (GUI) and utilizes Langchain to interact with the LLM.

## Install dependencies

1. Do the following before installing the dependencies found in `requirements.txt` file because of current challenges installing `onnxruntime` through `pip install onnxruntime`.

   - For MacOS users, a workaround is to first install `onnxruntime` dependency for `chromadb` using:

   ```python
    conda install onnxruntime -c conda-forge
   ```

   See this [thread](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/11037) for additonal help if needed.

   - For Windows users, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/bycloudai/InstallVSBuildToolsWindows?tab=readme-ov-file) to install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools. Be sure to follow through to the last step to set the enviroment variable path.

2. Install Tesseract [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) is an open source OCR or optical character recognition engine and command line program.

3. Now run this command to install dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install markdown depenendies with:

```python
pip install "unstructured[md]"
```

## Usage

To use the application, execute the `main.py` file using the Streamlit CLI. Make sure you have [Streamlit installed](https://docs.streamlit.io/) before running the application. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
streamlit run main.py
```
